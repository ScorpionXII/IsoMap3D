IsoMap3D Framework
==================

Getting Started
---------------
IsoMap3D is an online "pseudo-isometric" 3D framework with a built-in map editor. It's based on Away3D Flash Engine v3.4 and works well in every web browser with a Flash Player Plugin installed.

Why "Pseudo-Isometric"?
-----------------------
Because the viewport camera have a configuration to represents isometric projection but you can rotate the map or switch between 3D/2D. Everything inside the map is a real 3D object with mapped textures.

What can I do with this?
------------------------
IsoMap3D was born in late 2009, when I was finishing the race of Engineering in Computer Science at the University. At that time 3D visualization techniques on the web were primitive and although there were alternatives like WebGL, did not allow much interaction to create a virtual environment for the design of a city or implement the logic of a MMO game. Away3D then seemed to offer enough power to achieve, but it was necessary to implement all the logic for a basic environment that allowed interact with elements such as streets, buildings, trees to create maps and implement an editor to work visually with each item. IsoMap3D eventually became my diploma thesis in mid 2010. Therefore, it is oriented mainly to create web-based online as virtual models of cities SimCity or video games etc ...
