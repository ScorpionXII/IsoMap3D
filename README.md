IsoMap3D Framework
==================

Getting Started
---------------
IsoMap3D is an online "pseudo-isometric" 3D framework with a built-in map editor. It's based on Away3D Flash Engine v3.4 and works well in every web browser with a Flash Player Plugin installed.

Why "Pseudo-Isometric"?
-----------------------
Because the viewport camera have a configuration to represents isometric projection but you can rotate the map or switch between 3D/2D. Everything inside the map is a real 3D object with mapped textures.

What can I do with this?
------------------------
IsoMap3D born in late 2009 when I was finishing the Informatics Sciences Engineering carrer at the university. At that time the 3D visualization techniques on the web were primitive and although there were alternatives like WebGL interaction do not allow much interaction to create a virtual environment for layout a city or implement the logic of a MMO game. By then Away3D seemed to offer enough power to achieve but it was necessary to implement all the logic to get a basic environment that allowed interact with elements such as streets, buildings, trees to create maps and implement an editor to work visually with each item. IsoMap3D finally became my diploma thesis in mid-2010. So it is oriented primarily to create online web-based video games like SimCity or virtual models of cities, etc...
